## HOW TRAFFT’S BOOKING SYSTEM WORKS WITH WORDPRESS

Through seamless integration with WordPress, [Trafft](https://trafft.com/?utm_source=plugin&utm_medium=wp_org&utm_content=link&utm_campaign=wp_org) grants you the capability to effortlessly incorporate the booking form into any WordPress site with minimal effort.

With this setup in place, you’ll be able to convert more website visitors into loyal customers.

Being an integration for Trafft SaaS, this booking plugin involves specific calls to external servers that store your account data:

## FAQ

**How to locate the name that needs to be entered in the "Trafft account URL" field?**

This is the name that you've entered as your booking domain during the Sign Up process on [Trafft](https://trafft.com/). Typically, it is your business name, and we automatically filled the "Your Booking domain" field based on the Business name you entered. However, if you've changed it afterward, the name entered for the Booking domain is what you need. By entering and saving this name, we can load resources from your account, enabling you to use the Trafft Booking form on your WordPress website.

**Please note:** If you've used our Custom Domain option, simply enter the segment of the URL displayed when accessing the Trafft SaaS admin dashboard.


**I've inserted the booking form, but I'm missing specific services, locations, or employees. What could be the issue?**

There can be several reasons for this:
1. If certain service is missing first check if you have selected "This is a private service" option, since in that case the service will not be available for booking on the booking form;
2. Please check whether all employees are assigned to the services;
3. Check if the working hours are correctly set and all services fit the working periods;
4. Check if the services and locations are added to the working hours, and
5. Check if all employees, services and locations are **Enabled**.

**Which page Builders are supported?**

Currently, we offer integrations with Gutenberg and Elementor. However, additional integrations are on our roadmap.

**Can I select multiple services using "Preselect Booking Parameters" option?**

**Can I customize the booking forms to match my website's branding?**

Yes, Trafft's WordPress booking system offers customization options, allowing you to tailor the booking forms to match your website's branding. You can adjust colors, fonts, and other design elements to create a cohesive and professional look.
